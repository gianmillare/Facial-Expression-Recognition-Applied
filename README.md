# Facial-Expression-Recognition-Applied
This project is my attempt at applying what I learned from the [Facial Expression Recognition](https://www.coursera.org/learn/facial-expression-recognition-keras/home/welcome) course. I use the notes and skills I picked up from the course to 'accurately' depict the facial expressions of my friends, family, and favorite tv-show characters. 

I loved the process of building this app because, although I have a huge passion for machine learning, I had no idea of where to start. This machine learning application allowed me to use my personal interests (family, friends, and relateble characters) as a sample for my aspirations. 

Instructions: If you would like to use this application, clone the files (via the green Code button), throw your desired video into the "videos" folder, and change the path to the video in the camera.py file. Run a terminal/bash, cd into the folder containing "main.py" and run "python main.py".
