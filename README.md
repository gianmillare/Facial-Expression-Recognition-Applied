# Facial-Expression-Recognition-Applied
This project is my attempt at applying what I learned from the [Facial Expression Recognition](https://www.coursera.org/learn/facial-expression-recognition-keras/home/welcome) course. I use the notes and skills I picked up from the course to 'accurately' depict the facial expressions of my friends, family, and favorite caroon/anime characters.
